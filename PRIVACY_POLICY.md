# Privacy Policy for AI-AGENT

**Last updated: September 26, 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how AI-AGENT ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information.

## 1. Data We Collect

When you connect your social media accounts (Google, LinkedIn, Instagram) to AI-AGENT, we collect and store the following information in our secure database (Supabase):

*   **Authentication Tokens:** We store the OAuth access tokens and refresh tokens provided by the services you connect. These are used to make API calls on your behalf.
*   **Session ID:** A unique identifier for your browser session to link you to your stored tokens.
*   **User Identifiers:** Account-specific IDs provided by the service (e.g., your Instagram User ID or LinkedIn URN) that are necessary to direct API calls to the correct account.

We DO NOT collect or store your password, personal email address, name, or any other personal information for any purpose other than what is required for the application's core functionality.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

Your data is used exclusively to perform actions that you explicitly request through the AI agent's chat interface. For example:

*   Using your Google token to send an email you have composed.
*   Using your LinkedIn token to publish a post you have written.
*   Using your Instagram token to post a photo you have provided.

Your data is never sold, shared, or used for marketing or any other purpose.

## 3. Data Deletion Instructions

You have the right to request the deletion of your data at any time. To do so, please follow these steps:

1.  **Send an email** to **naveennegi0804@gmail.com** with the subject line "Data Deletion Request".
2.  In the body of the email, please state that you wish to have your AI-AGENT data deleted.

Upon receiving your request, we will permanently delete all associated authentication tokens and user identifiers from our database within 72 hours. Deleting this data will immediately revoke the application's ability to access your accounts.

You can also revoke access at any time directly from the security settings of your Google, LinkedIn, or Facebook/Instagram account.
